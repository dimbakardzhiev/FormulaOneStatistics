# Formula One Statistics README

The Formula One Statistics application uses open data from https://www.kaggle.com/cjgdev/formula-1-race-data-19502017 to
compare the race statistics of seven current Formula One drivers, Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso, Felipe Massa, 
Sebastian Vettel, Nico Hulkenberg, Sergio Perez and Daniel Ricciardo, across the seasons 2012-2017. It does so by using
a range of pie charts, line charts and column charts. The application also makes us live twitter data, displaying the 15 most
recent twitter mentions of Lewis Hamilton in real time.
